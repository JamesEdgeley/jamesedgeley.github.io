## Determining the Reaction Zone Length in Shock Initiated PETN
### Abstract

Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a secondary explosive used in electrical detonators in the form of a pressed powder. The reaction zone length of PETN is smaller than that of most other explosives, therefore there is a lack of data due to insufficient resolution of existing methods. Furthermore, most prior work has been on steady state behaviour, so the transition regime before steady state is particularly poorly understood.

The research described in this thesis was undertaken in order to characterise the reaction zone length and wave curvature during the evolution from initiation to steady state. The investigation was focused on a detonator setting, so confined cylindrical pellets of a similar scale were used here. To separate the effect of the chemical reaction from the mechanical response to shock, plate impact experiments were performed on an inert simulant: a fine icing sugar with comparable particle size. The shock velocity and rise time were found to exhibit dependence on the thickness of the bed, suggesting that these effects may also play a role in PETN prior to development of detonation.

A fibre launched laser flyer detonator system was constructed to allow repeatable shock initiation of the target samples with a high throughput. This apparatus could produce a highly tuneable shock without much of the electrical noise present with electrical detonators.

High-rate capacitive sensing was applied as a technique for measuring detonation properties in small columns of PETN. Development of the diagnostic incorporated design of the sensor itself, event synchronisation handling and noise reduction. A custom-made data processing algorithm was used to extract useful information from the sensor signal. This technology was found to have the temporal and spatial resolution required, as well as being cheaper and easier to implement than competing methods. Experiments using this diagnostic were performed to measure the reaction zone length and curvature for a range of densities and sample sizes. The data could also be used to calculate detonation velocity and ’lost time’. An important part of these experiments was the creation of consistent target samples.

A hydrocode incorporating the CREST reactive model was written to numerically model the detonation and provide a predictive capability. The results of the experiments were used to set the values of the parameters in the simulation.

## Capacitive Sensing for Measuring the Conduction Zone of Low Density Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN)
*Journal of Applied Physics*\
*13 November 2023*
### Abstract
We present a novel diagnostic system, based on the the principle of capacitive sensing, capable of detecting the conduction zone of detonating explosives. The method relies on measuring the change in the capacitive coupling between a printed circuit and its surroundings, induced by an increase in local conductivity. A high frequency wave generator provides the driving signal which is modified by the change in coupling. This method boasts a greater sensitivity than existing conductivity-based techniques, with comparable spatial and temporal resolution. The subject material was pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) powder, pressed into low density (50% to 85% theoretical maximum density (TMD)) cylindrical columns. Previous attempts to measure the reaction zone of low density PETN have faced difficulties because of its short length and low conductivity compared to other explosives. The PETN was initiated using a laser flyer detonator in order to reach detonation promptly and with a minimum of electrical noise. Application of the capacitive sensor diagnostic and subsequent analysis yielded a density dependent steady-state reaction zone length of between 45 μm and 78 μm.

## Development of Capacitive Sensors for the Study of Detonation
*24th New Trends in Research of Energetic Materials International Conference*\
*6–8 April 2022*\
*Pardubice, Czech Republic*
### Abstract
A novel capacitive sensor has been designed and manufactured to allow for spatially and temporally resolved measurements to be made of materials in the time before steady state detonation has developed. The sensors are driven by a high frequency waveform generator and then the effects of the conductive zone within the reaction front alter the shape of the waveform which is then detected using a high bandwidth oscilloscope. Details are given of the analysis routine, along with some examples of the results that are obtainable.

## Capacitive Sensing for Measuring Detonations
*21st Biennial Conference of the APS Topical Group on Shock Compression of Condensed Matter*\
*16–21 June 2019*\
*Portland, Oregon , US*

### Abstract
Novel sensors have been developed to measure the time resolved position and thickness of the conducting zone of detonation waves in columns of explosive. The sensors employ the phenomenon of capacitive coupling to distinguish between the reaction zone, unreacted explosive and reaction products based on the change in conductivity. An electrode is driven with a squarewave alternating voltage, which induces a stronger displacement current in the conducting reaction zone than elsewhere. The size of the coupling effect is then inferred by measuring the relaxation time of the circuit. Unlike some other electromagnetic sensors, these are not embedded within the material, but instead are designed to be positioned on the outer surface. This paper describes the design of the sensors and an initial test. A fibre-coupled laser flyer system has been built to perform initiation experiments.

## Characterising Shock Propagation through Inert Beds
*20th Biennial Conference of the APS Topical Group on Shock Compression of Condensed Matter*\
*9–14 July 2017*\
*St. Louis, Missouri, US*
### Abstract
Studies of granular materials have indicated that non-steady shock behaviour can arise over short distances when they are dynamically compacted. Unlike continuous materials, granular powders undergo irreversible compaction, which leads to hysteresis during the unloading phase. In this study, ultrafine sucrose with a mean particle size of 8μm was subjected to a planar shock from plate impact. Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) was used to measure the velocity history of the rear surface, and an evaporated make-trigger to measure the time-of-arrival on the front surface, which together allowed some elements of the shock’s behaviour inside the bed to be deduced. Non-steady behaviour was indicated by the rise time and the average velocity of the shock varying with bed thickness. The effect of the thickness of the bed on the shock also extended to the release; thinner beds exhibited a more elastic rarefaction.

## Experimental and numerical study of detonation reaction zones
*SMF Seminar*\
*9 February, 2023*\
*Cambridge, UK*
### Abstract
The chemical reaction zone is the region in a detonating explosive between the initial pressure spike and the sonic locus.  Its length is affected by the properties of the explosive, and in some circumstances is difficult to determine experimentally.  The reaction zone of one explosive (PETN) was measured using a capacitive sensing technique, and the results were used to develop a reactive hydrocode.

## Investigation of the Reaction Zone of PETN initiated by a Laser Flyer
*Defence and Security Doctoral Symposium*\
*13 November, 2018*\
*Swindon, UK*
### Abstract
A laser flyer system has been built to launch aluminium/alumina flyers into small, low density pellets of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The beam profile was homogenised by dispersive smoothing through a length of optical fibre and continuously analysed with a range of diagnostics. By varying the thickness and velocity of the flyer, experiments can be performed with a range of input shock magnitudes and durations. Microfabricated sensors to be used in conjunction with this system are under development – these are based on measuring the effect that the electrical conductivity of the reaction zone has on the resistance and capacitance of the sensors’ electrodes.  Without the electrical noise produced by a conventional bridgewire detonator, laser flyers offer a possible way to probe the electrical properties of the detonation reaction zone.  Developing an understanding of the reaction zone will give more clues as to the mechanism behind initiation in different scenarios.
