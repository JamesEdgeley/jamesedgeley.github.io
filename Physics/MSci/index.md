## Non-Linear Effects in Plasma
### Abstract
A particle-in-cell code is developed and used to test efficacy of magnetic confinement. The program allows visualisation of electromagnetic fields and their source terms. The particlesâ€™ velocity distribution function is measured relative to a Maxwellian distribution. A solver is written using OpenFOAM for magnetohydrodynamic equations in the thermal limit. The theory behind non-linear theory set out by Tsytovich (1970) is expounded using the current density as an example. Finally the Landau treatment of non-linear effects is presented and applied to demonstrate damping of plasma waves.
